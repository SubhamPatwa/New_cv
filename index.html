          <p><em>Learning to get a <strong>better job</strong></em></p>
          <p><strong>In life, winners are those that are resolute and pursue their goals,
            and losers are those that don’t attempt to make an effort at all. What
            is the difference between them? People consider winners to be super intelligent
            and losers to be really lazy, but this may not always be the case. Though
            brainpower plays a minor role in determining the success of a person, it is
            not just this factor that determines the success or failure of a person. The
            winners are those who work meticulously every step of the way and stay
            resilient even when they do not succeed. However, on the other hand, losers
            fall down, never to get up; they surrender before even meeting a challenge. My
            dad, gifted with a photographic memory, preferred to !ire more idly rather
            than work hard for his future. Being the only son in the family, he was spoil;
            all he had to do was go to school and study. However, as a high school student
            , he chose to spend his life outrageously by following other students’ ideals
            of drug use and parties. As the results, he was a drug addict and had to drop
            out of school immediately. Instead of choosing a better path by using his
            talents where he could be a well-known doctor, he  squandered every chance of
            becoming someone great. As for my ad. She had to work and study aunt, she
            wasn’t fortunate like my ad ad.  at the same time. Based on our Vietnamese’s
            tradition, girls don’t need high education; we just only need to know how to
            cook and sew. So instead of being proud, my grandmother yelled at her for
            studying so hard; ignoring for the fact that she wanted to. Despite all
            the mistakes that she made during the way, she chose the path of diligence
            and succeeded in life where her brother failed.</strong></p>
